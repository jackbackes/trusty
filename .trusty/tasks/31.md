# Implement prune command to identify stale tasks

Add 'trusty prune' command that identifies potentially stale tasks based on: tasks that keep getting skipped, relatively old tasks (80th percentile or older), blocked dependencies, low priority with no updates, or completed subtasks. Uses exponential backoff to avoid repeatedly suggesting the same task. Offers to complete tasks that seem done, or cancel truly stale ones. Interactive review before any changes.
